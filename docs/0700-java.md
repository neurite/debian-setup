### Java SDK

Debian promotes OpenJDK.

To install the JDKs,
```bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-source
```

Note source installs at `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/src.zip`.

To list the available Java runtime packages,
```bash
apt-cache search --names-only 'java.*runtime'
```

To list the available Java SDKs,
```bash
apt-cache search --names-only 'jdk'
```

To choose which version of Java to run as the default,
```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

### Java Applications

All of the Java tools are self-contained. Instead of installing them via `apt-get`, do the following for each app:

1. Download the latest version
2. Unpack it in `~/Applications`
3. Add the executable to the `PATH` environment variable in `~/.bashrc`

Install the following Java apps following the above steps:

* [Ant](http://www.google.com/search?q=apache+ant+download)
* [Maven](http://www.google.com/search?q=apache+maven+download)
* [Groovy](http://www.google.com/search?q=groovy+download)
* [Gradle](http://www.google.com/search?q=gradle+download)
* [Grails](http://www.google.com/search?q=grails+download)
* [JMeter](http://www.google.com/search?q=apache+jmeter+download)
* [Scala](http://www.google.com/search?q=scala+download)
* [sbt](http://www.google.com/search?q=sbt+download)
* [Play Framework](http://www.google.com/search?q=play+framework+download)

## bash Environment

Add the following to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# $JAVA_HOME is needed by certain Java apps.
# But no need to add $JAVA_HOME on $PATH; Java should already be on $PATH
export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64"

export ANT_HOME="${HOME}/Applications/apache-ant-1.9.4"
PATH="${ANT_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

export MAVEN_HOME="${HOME}/Applications/apache-maven-3.3.9"
PATH="${MAVEN_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

export GROOVY_HOME="{HOME}/Applications/groovy-2.4.0"
PATH="${GROOVY_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

export GRADLE_HOME="${HOME}/Applications/gradle-3.0"
PATH="${GRADLE_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

export SCALA_HOME="${HOME}/Applications/scala-2.11.6"
PATH="${SCALA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

export SBT_HOME="${HOME}/Applications/sbt-0.13.7"
PATH="${SBT_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

export PLAY_HOME="${HOME}/Applications/play-2.2.6"
PATH="${PLAY_HOME}:${PATH}"
```

Note this approach has the advantage of keeping multiple versions of the same app and easily switch the versions in `~/.bashrc`. If a version of an app is not needed, just remove the folder and its content.

Remember to source `~/.bashrc` in `~/.bash_profile` if you haven't done so already (see [bash](0602-bash.md)).

### Eclipse

1. Download Eclipse Standard Edition, unpack it in `~/Applications`.

2. The unpacked Eclipse is in folder `eclipse`. Rename it to the full name of that of the downloaded package, e.g. eclipse-java-neon-1a, so that a) we can track the version of Eclipse and b) multiple distributions of Eclipse can coexist.

3. `vim [eclipse-folder]/eclipse.ini`, add:

    ```
    -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
    -Xss1m
    -Xms1024m
    -Xmx4096m
    ```
    
    For Luna SR2 on Debian, also add the following lines in `eclipse.ini` before `launcher.appendVmargs`

    ```
    --launcher.GTK_version
    2
    ```
    
    Note, on a Mac, the `ini` file is located at `Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse.ini`.

4. Add the file `~/.local/share/applications/eclipse-java.desktop`. This should add the Eclipse app to the desktop menu.

    ```
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=Eclipse Java
    Comment=Java IDE
    Exec=/home/<usr>/Applications/eclipse-java-neon-1a/eclipse
    Icon=/home/<usr>/Applications/eclipse-java-neon-1a/icon.xpm
    Terminal=false
    Type=Application
    Categories=Development;Programming;IDE;
    StartupNotify=true
    ```

5. Note we can install multiple distributions of Eclipse. We can even customize the same distribution of Eclipse and keep the customized copies for different purposes. For example, make a copy of the Eclipse folder at step 2 and give it a different configuration at step 4. This is how I keep two Eclipse, one for Java, one for Scala. Here is the Eclipse Scala desktop entry file (`~/.local/share/applications/eclipse-scala.desktop`):

    ```
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=Eclipse Scala
    Comment=Scala IDE
    Exec=/home/<usr>/Applications/eclipse-scala-SDK-4.0.0-vfinal-2.11/eclipse
    Icon=/home/<usr>/Applications/eclipse-scala-SDK-4.0.0-vfinal-2.11/icon.xpm
    Terminal=false
    Type=Application
    Categories=Development;Programming;IDE;
    StartupNotify=true
    ```

6. Install the Scala plugin (alternatively there is a customized distribution of Eclipse for Scala)
    * Eclipse update site: `http://download.scala-ide.org/sdk/helium/e38/scala211/stable/site`
    * Installed the following
        * Scala IDE for Eclipse
        * ScalaTest
    * When Eclipse restarts, it will run `Setup Diagnostics`
        * Make sure `JDT Weaving` is checked

7. Customization
    * At startup, it asks for the default work space folder. Point it at `~/Workspace`.
    * Font: Window -> Preferences -> General > Appearance -> Colors and Fonts -> Basic -> Text Font. Choose `Droid Sans Mono`.
    * If `Droid Sans Mono` is chosen as above, bold fonts can mess up the spacing. Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Syntax Coloring, uncheck all the bold fonts.
    * Spaces-Only: Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter.
